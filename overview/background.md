### Background
* Almost completely unrelated to Java
* Loosely typed
* A lot of bad and good parts
* No classes
* Object oriented

### Key Ideas
* Load and go delivery
* Loose typing
* Object as general containers
* Prototypal inheritance
* Lambda
* Linkage through global variables 

### Loosely Typed
* Any of these types can be stored in a variable, or passed as a parameter to any function
* the language is not *untyped*

### C
* JavaScript is syntactically a C family language
* It differs from C mainly in its type system, which allows functions to be  values

### Identifiers
* starts with a letter or _ or $
* Followed by zero or more letters, digits, _ or $
* By convention, all variables, parameters, members, and function names start with lowercase
* except for constructors which start with uppercase
* initial _ should be reserved for implementations
* $ should be reserved for machines

### Reserved Words
* There are a lot of them
